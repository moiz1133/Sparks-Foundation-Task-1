# Sparks-Foundation-Task-1
The tak is to predict the number of scores expected based on number of study hours daily. I used Linear Regression from Skicit_learn to predict my values. First I trained my model, then made predictions using test set and then calculated the score based on 9.25 hours/day of study which is 94.73975630005863. I evaluate my model using mean_absolute_error which 6.1.

I used the online dataset from  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv
